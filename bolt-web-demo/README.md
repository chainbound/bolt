# BOLT web demo

This is a simple full-stack example of BOLT preconfirmations. It's a simple web app that
allows users to send transactions and get a fast preconfirmation response.

A list of event logs show the pipeline of the transaction, from the moment the user sends it
to the moment it gets included on-chain.

## Usage

```shell
cd frontend && yarn && yarn dev

cd backend && yarn && yarn dev
```
